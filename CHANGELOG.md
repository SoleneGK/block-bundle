## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Add a `Block` entity with `JOINED` inheritance to handle end user blocks
- Add an optional parameter `parameters` to `umanit_block_render` which will be passed to the block manager `render`
method
- Add a `Block` entity on which all block should rely
- Add an `AbstractBlockType` form type on which all managers form type should rely
- Add a new form theme for Sylius
- Add new javascripts events
    * `ublock.on_sort_start` before sorting blocks in a panel
    * `ublock.on_sort_end` after sorting blocks in a panel

### Changed
- Entities table are prefixed with `umanit_`
- Make the Twig extension lazy loaded
- A block manager is no longer a subclass of Symfony form `AbstractType` but it should define the form type used to
manage his block with `getManagedFormType`
- Move existing form theme and assets in a `sonata` namespace

### Removed
- Drop support for PHP < 7.1
- Drop support for Symfony < 4.4
- Remove `PanelEventSubscriber` as it becomes useless with the new entity inheritance
- Remove useless `umanit_block` configuration class
- The `AbstractBlockManager` no longer own an `Engine` attribute; If your block rendering needs a template, you must
inject the `@twig` service yourself
